Intermediate MySQL Demo

MySQL Demonstration including generation of common table expressions, a stored function, stored procedures, and triggers. Window function coming soon.

Will potentially add a subquery at a later time, though I find CTEs and Window Functions to be more effective for similar uses.

A project utilizing primary keys, foreign keys, and joins will be generated at a later time, but this data set is simple enough that breaking it down further would be a waste.
