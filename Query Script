# Neil Collins MySQL Database Demo

CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS studperformance;

USE studperformance;

# Data was loaded from CSV using Table Data Import Wizard, file name: studentsperformance.csv

RENAME TABLE studentsperformance TO performance;

SELECT * FROM performance;

# Breaking this table down into multiple tables would make it more complicated than it needs to begin
# If I were working with a more complex data set, I would generate multiple tables, generate primary keys, and link them with foreign keys
# However, that would just make the data dirtier to work with needlessly. I will attempt to find a proper data set to demonstrate joins at a later date.
